        I am a biomedical researcher.

    <p>
        I study the functional and molecular implications of cancer-associated mutations in a
        critical tumor suppressor. I use biochemical and molecular biology approaches to investigate
        the molecular landscape of one of the common hotspot mutations seen in endometrial cancers.

        Prior to this, I studied Adenovirus-induced cellular DNA damage response, cell cycle, and DNA
        replication. The findings from my work show that Ad-induction of DDR is necessary for the
        activation of G2/M checkpoint kinases in E4-mutant infected cells. We also showed that
        E4-mutant infected cells are arrested at a phase characterized by either 4N or &gt;4N DNA
        content while preventing cells from going through mitosis.

    <p>
        I have also investigated the efficacy of artemisinin- and lumefantrine-based combination
        therapy (ACT) in treating <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> malaria in Nepal. This multi-institutional
        collaborative work was warranted by the emergence of artemisinin resistance and the detection
        of resistance-associated Kelch 13 (K13) mutations in infected patients in the Greater Mekong
        subregion. We conducted a therapeutic efficacy study in falciparum malaria patients treated
        with ACT in regions with high mobility of migrant workers.

        hikes and walks.
