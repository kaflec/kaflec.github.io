        I am a biomedical researcher.

    <p>
        I study the functional and molecular implications of cancer-associated mutations in a
        critical tumor suppressor. I use biochemical and molecular biology approaches to investigate
        the molecular landscape of common hotspot mutations seen in endometrial cancers.

        Prior to this, I studied Adenovirus-induced cellular DNA damage response, cell cycle, and DNA
        replication. The findings from my work show that Ad-induction of DDR is necessary for the
        activation of G2/M checkpoint kinases in E4-mutant infected cells. We also showed that
        E4-mutant infected cells are arrested at a phase characterized by either 4N or &gt;4N DNA
        content while preventing cells from going through mitosis.

        I also investigated the efficacy of artemisinin–lumefantrine–based combination therapy (ACT) for the treatment of <i>Plasmodium falciparum </i> malaria in Nepal. 
        In this multi-institutional collaborative study, we conducted a therapeutic efficacy assessment among falciparum malaria patients 
        treated with ACT in regions of Nepal characterized by high mobility of migrant workers.

        hikes and walks.
